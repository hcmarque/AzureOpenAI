Now it's time to work on the Model that you just deployed on the previous step. Select the Deployment Model, in this example, "text-davinci-003" and as well one of the examples or use cases that you are targeting, in this example, "Summarize Text" will be used.

![Recording 2023-02-10 at 09 47 37](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13455341/218120850-585fb31c-ae8c-4b85-9c7a-693e39fcf427.gif)

You will be able to see that a message will appears showing which model this example would works better. In case of Summarization, the model text-davinci-002 would works better. Click on "Create deployment"

As a new Deployment model was created, named "text-davinci-002", select it, as well the "Summarize text" and click in Generate on the bottom of the page to see the results of the example, in green.

![Recording 2023-02-10 at 09 49 12](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13455341/218121184-b98b0730-a294-4eec-8be5-4af8b3fe580c.gif)

## Understanding the Max Length (tokens)

The Max length (tokens) on Azure OpenAI means a set a limit on the number of tokens to generate in a response. The system supports a maximum of 4000 tokens shared between a given prompt and response completion. (One token is roughly 4 characters for typical English text)

Token refers to a unit of text used to represent a word or piece of punctuation in a computational process. Tokens are often used as the basis for processing and generating natural language text using artificial intelligence models such as OpenAI's GPT-3. The number of tokens in a given piece of text can impact the complexity of processing and generating a response, and setting a token limit can help to ensure that the generated response remains concise and manageable.

## Additional GPT-3 Playground models

* Azure OpenAI Studio is a platform that provides access to OpenAI's advanced AI technologies, including its cutting-edge language models, to help businesses and developers build advanced applications. Some of the services available in Azure OpenAI Studio include:

   - GPT-3 Language Model: This is the latest and most advanced language model from OpenAI, capable of performing a wide range of natural language processing tasks such as text generation, language translation, and sentiment analysis.
   - Text Generation: A service that allows you to generate new text based on a prompt or sample text, using the GPT-3 language model.
   - Text Classification: A service that allows you to classify text into predefined categories based on its content, using machine learning algorithms.
   - Named Entity Recognition: A service that identifies named entities in text, such as people, organizations, and locations.
   - Sentiment Analysis: A service that analyzes the sentiment or emotional tone of a piece of text.
   - Text Translation: A service that translates text from one language to another.
   - Natural Language to SQL:  This service can be used to simplify the process of querying databases, as it enables users to ask questions in plain English and receive results in the form of structured data.

![Recording 2023-02-10 at 11 57 37](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13455341/218150823-b92b6633-69a8-4284-95d0-5ae391b2ee90.gif)

These are just a few examples of the services available in Azure OpenAI Studio. The platform is continually evolving and expanding its capabilities, so new services and features may become available in the future. 

## Accessing Azure OpenAI API's

To access Azure OpenAI APIs, you will need to have an Azure account and a subscription to the Azure OpenAI service. Once you have access to the Azure OpenAI platform, you can use the API by following these steps:

Obtain API credentials: To access the API, you will need to obtain an API key or access token that can be used to authenticate your API requests. You can obtain API credentials from the Azure portal.

To connect the Azure OpenAI API to other Azure services, you will need to use the API to retrieve data and then store that data in an Azure database or storage service. You can also use the API to trigger other Azure services, such as Azure Functions, to perform additional processing on the data.

Note that access to the Azure OpenAI API is subject to usage limits and other restrictions, as specified in the Azure OpenAI service agreement. To avoid hitting usage limits, you should carefully manage your API usage and implement rate limiting in your application.

* **Step 1:** Access the API call as a reference for your application. Back to the Summarization use case, and click on View Code on the top right.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13455341/218162830-202f0f51-c719-43ea-8aea-029c724f5e39.png)

* **Step 2:** Copy (and take note of) the API parameter on top of the Sample Code. In this example, the API was:
https://xxxxxxxxxx/openai/deployments/text-davinci-002/completions?api-version=2022-12-01

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13455341/218164226-8a6a6dd4-b147-466c-a4e4-be1f39642116.png)

* **Step 3:** Go back to the [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com/), inside of your Azure OpenAI Services to access the API Key.

The Keys and Endpoints are located underneath the Resource Management menu on the left blade (as highlighted on the picture below)

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13455341/218166042-16b95ebc-7ae1-432c-b2a7-80e4bf223589.png)

* **Step 4:** These keys are used to access your Cognitive Service API. Do not share your keys. Store them securely in a vault such as an Azure Key Vault. We also recommend regenerating these keys regularly. Only one key is necessary to make an API call. When regenerating the first key, you can use the second key for continued access to the service.
